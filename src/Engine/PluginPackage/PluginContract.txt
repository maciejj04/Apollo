All Plugins have to fulfill following requirements in order to be loaded and executed properly:
- Plugins are classes
- implement abstract class "PluginAbstractModel"
- File name suffix should contain "Plugin" - e.g.: SSAPlugin.
- Plugins have to return theirs output in for of a string.
- Plugin will be informed about each portion of data which was just read from mic, it's plugins business if it handles
    it immediately or not(in this case it's assumed to return empty string).
- PluginLoader class assumes that plugin class name is the same as containing module name.
- All plugin files have to be placed in src.Engine.PluginModule.plugins package, otherwise they wont be automatically
    loaded on application startup.
- StaticAudio.rawData is a static part of PluginAbstractModel class.
- Plugin can react to application events aka Messages. In order to enable it, simply implement MessageClient abstract class.
    and register to desirable event.


Possible improvements:
- Plugin can return Dictionary with fields associated with their destination(e.g. UI). Contract can enforce specified fields.
